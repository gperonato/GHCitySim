GHCitySim
========================================
Set of Grasshopper components for interfacing with CitySim, an urban-scale building energy simulation tool.

GHCitySim requires [GHPython](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghpython "GhPython"), [Ladybug and Honeybee](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/ladybug-honeybee "Ladybug + Honeybee") to be installed.
A copy of the components from Ladybug and Honeybee needed to run GHCitySim is contained in this repository.

The GHCitySim components are saved both as compiled GH components (/userObjects) and source code (/src).
To install, just drag and drop the files in the /UserObjects directory onto the Grasshopper canvas.

In the resources folder you will find:
* a *.ghx file containing a sample Grasshopper definition where the components are used;
* a sample weather file in CitySim format *.cli;
* a reference XML file in CitySim format.
