# GHCitySim
Set of Grasshopper components for interfacing with CitySim.
These components will be hopefully integrated into Honeybee.

In the resources folder you will find:
* a *.ghx file containing a sample Grasshopper definition where the components are used;
* a sample weather file in CitySim format *.cli;
* a reference XML file in CitySim format.
